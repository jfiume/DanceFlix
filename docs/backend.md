# Backend

DanceFlix runs on Ruby on Rails and is hosted on Heroku. The backend provides RESTful APIs and responds with JSON data.

## Heroku

Uptime Robot application performance management (APM) pings the Heroku dyno, keeping it awake for faster user response.

## Database

PostgreSQL works very well with Heroku.

## Dependencies

Other notable dependencies include:

- Cloudinary for image attachment and processing
- BCrypt for password-salting and hashing for a secure authentication system
- YouTube for video hosting
